# Portafolio


 For this project I was using the technologies of Typescript, Tailwind, React, React-router, emailjs, formik, Yup. I created a small web page with the technologies I use, the page is repositive so it can be adapted to a phone without any problem, also in the last instance I added a small blog with some articles, we use formik to make the pertinent validations of the contact form and to send emails we are using emailjs.
